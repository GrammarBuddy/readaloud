I am building a new webapp called ReadRight. This is an app for users to improve their English reading skills


1. I already has a json named passages.json where there are English reading paragraphs under three difficulty level ... easy, medium and hard


2. I want you to built my index.html ... and should have nice round edged buttons on the top .... Easy, Medium and Hard


3. Below i need a speed slider ... where users can decide the speed at which the reading paragraph is going to slide up ... it can be 50 to 300 WPM ... default speed can be 100

4. AFter this speed slider ... i want the actual text box where the text will scroll from the bottom to top 


4. Below that I need a start button ... which once clicked should start a 3, 2, 1 countdown in the text box with the text (Get Ready to Ready) immediately below the countdown


5. Once the countdown is over, the reading passage should appear from the bottom in the text box - scrolling up - the speed of the scroll should depend on the speed selected by the user ... and 100 is not selected by the user
6. 

6. Once the text starts scrolling up ... the start button should get replaced by two buttom (pause/resume button and reset button)


7. Pause should pause the scrolling ... and should resume where it stopped once the resume button is clicked

8. Reset to go back to the original beginning point ....



give me the necessary codes
